        My name is Teagan Davis and I am a first term student at 
        Indian Hills Community College in their Computer Software 
        Development course. I have been interested in coding since middle school
        and took my high school's coding class my senior year. I have played soccer
        for 10 years, and lettered all four years of high school. I participated on
        the robotics team with my high school as well, and I even partook in their
        compitition at state. I have also played in my communities orchestra since 
        4th grade and was first stand majority of my playing experience.
